## How To Install Locally
```bash
npm i -g yarn # if you don't have yarn yet
git clone https://github.com/PracticeJavaScript/practicejavascript.com.git
cd practicejavascript.com
yarn install
yarn run watch
```

That will build it all and watch the css, img, and js assets, then you can load up `/public/index.html` in a browser. narf!
